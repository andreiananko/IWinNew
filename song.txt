Oh, the wind whistles down
The cold dark street tonight
And the people, they were dancing
To the music vibe
And the boys chase the girls with curls in their hair
While the shy tormented youth sit way over there
And the songs get louder each one better than before
And you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
